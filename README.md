This one-button game exposes some of the issues with AI (change this word to "automated") bots that are creeping into every technology of today. Here are some of the issues highlighted in the game.

1. ChatGPT recently became a "Groveling Sycophant" https://futurism.com/openai-chatgpt-sycophant
2. In order to "gameify" the bot, I added badges, timer, and score, even though these elements are basically absurd because they are not useful in this context. You just get points no matter what option you click and the bot doesn't even register your answer. The bot "selects" one of the words from the many answers that you give. This highlights absurdity in this relationship between humans and automated bots.
3. The automated responses are absurd both in the voices and their verbiage.
